I've been reading and hearing from a number of sources that suggest that the big, exciting companies hiring in the IT field, companies such as Google, StackOverflow and Microsoft, don't hold a college degree or industry certification to deserve significant consideration in hiring. Instead these companies desire to see a portfolio of projects or open source contributions.  

In simplest terms it seems that companies desire employees who so adore technology that they get off work and come home to do more of it in their free time. These folks likely self-educate at their own cost, and on their own time. They're likely to be more experienced than peers since they spend more hours-per-day immersed in the field and they likely to take their work as a point of pride and thus invest heavily in it's quality. Employees who come in showing a portofolio of technology projects are probably the kind of person that will go the extra mile, and they're unlikely to be mere clock-punchers.
 
But I can't quite get to a point where I think those are the only people worth hiring to do the work. I know first hand that it's possible to love your work and still want to do something else when you go home. I think there are a number of ways to immerse yourself in your field and learn more about it without building projects nonstop. In my case, I may take interest in software technologies when I'm not at work but I don't tend to like working when it doesn't produce something I want or can use. While I recognize that this closely resembles a disinterest in technology, I want to emphasize that I **do** care. I really do like to learn and work with tools I've never used before, but it's not simple for me to spend hours of work on a project for which I have no use. I prefer to work on things that get me to where I'm trying to go. As such I find that after work, at least since I graduated, I tend to come home and do housework, work on a few hobbies that I hope to expand, spend time with my family and friends and work on a number of personal self-improvement tasks. With that in mind, I've not yet found an extracurricular development opportunity that seemed simultaneously relevant to me, worthwhile to my interest or those of others, and which I could reasonably hope to engage with(Linux Kernel development is pretty exclusive and while it might be interesting and worthwhile, it's a bit beyond me at the moment).

Given my position, I'm a little worried and probably more than a little defensive about the idea that the only good developers are coding 24/7. 

I wanted to lay out my case about this in order to see if I'm understanding it well, monitor how it changes over time and perhaps get some feedback regarding the ideas I have. 

First, I think such individuals tend to be highly skilled in direct application I'm not sure it's so easily demonstrable that they are better at the job as a whole. Side projects suggest an investment in technology, but hobbies, community involvement and a robust family life can also suggest skills that are valuable.  Side projects can suggest that technology is a priority in a candidate's life, but involvement in church or community groups could suggest a facility for governance, process analysis, management , customer relations, training and more. My point is that I don't think technical side projects are suggestive of a superior candidate, when compared to other resume line-items.

Second, I worry when I read articles from influential people like Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood that suggest only the most ardent technologists should actually be working in the field. I worry because it seems cruel to tell a recent college graduate that their aspirations are not sufficiently all-consuming that they deserve to work in the field, which is exactly how it feels to read some of the things out there. Couple this with the constant advice to recent grads that failure to graduate with one-to-several projects on the side puts you on the bottom of the stack and I can't help but feel that there's no hope for mere mortals who need to sleep after class.

Third, I think there's something of an elitism in the most successful developers. Old-school developers who got started playing with computers in bedrooms and ended up owning a company in their 30s are possibly aware of how they got the best folks for their jobs, but they aren't necessarily experienced with how developers get into the field any more. In addition, because companies like Google can command the attention of thousands of applicants, they can afford to be incredibly exclusive, as can those of the most influential companies in the field. But not everyone can be a rockstar, and many of us would be glad to find our corner of the internet and try to keep the [cat pee](https://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks) off of it. I don't appreciate insinuations that if I can't be a rock star then I should not play.

In closing, let me say this. I love software, and I love computers. I also love mixology, theology, cooking, building and video games. I don't expect to ever be rich, I don't have dreams of running a business. I just want to provide for my wife and future kids while hopefully having a minute to work on other things. I don't like to think that my field will not support me if I can only offer mere hard work, or that there's no place for developers who do other things.  Some may find that their career is the place in which they fulfill their dreams. Some, like me, find that their dream is to have a pleasant career that allows them to pursue a wide range of opportunities.
